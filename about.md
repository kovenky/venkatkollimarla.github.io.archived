### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Venkat

I work as a **Machine Learning Engineer** at **Quicken Loans**, where I use my skills to empower bankers operate more efficiently and take good pricing decisions when they deal with customers about mortgage loans.
I help them accomplish these lofty goals by developing machine learning solutions.

I am an AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer with experience in ETL, data wrangling, building machine learning models.

**My Areas of Interests:** Research in artificial intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning Algorithms, Deep Learning, Neural Networks

I love building things and experimenting with new things, and I learn every day.
